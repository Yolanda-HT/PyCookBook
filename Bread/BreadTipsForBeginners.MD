Bead Making Tips:

1. Flour:
    - For dessert rolls, all purpose is okay. But with all purpose flour, you will not be able to knead to elastic film like stage
    - All purpose flour v.s. bread flour / cake flour:
      - 80g all purpose flour + 20g corn starch = 100g cake flour
      - 230 all purpose flour + 20g wheat gluten = 250g bread flour
2. Dough proofing
(Important! My mom used to have lots of trouble with this step…) This video shows very nicely how to see if dough is proofed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiPCEsoeCYs
3. Dough kneading by hand
Here is a video of kneading by hand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySOj0fFWo1U
4. Dough kneading with mixer
(Make sure to check the mixer’s manual, because mixing dough takes time and mixer can overheat, this is how our last mixer broke) You will need to use a dough hook, here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnD_2UUBEWU
