## Note:
For peach cream cheese filling:
- Peach nectar: I used Hero peach nectar.
- Frozen peaches: I used yellow peaches.
- You can also use fresh peaches and reduced nectar. 
- Fresh peaches: 
    - Pros: can use seasonal fruits of choice
    - Cons: hard to control sweetness and water content
- Frozen peaches:
    - Pros: reproducible and can make year round.
    - Cons: frozen peaches are not as fragrant as some of the fresh options
